# Background Music for EmulationStation

A python script to run background music in EmulationStation for Retropie,
inspired by the script posted [here](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/347/background-music-continued-from-help-support),
but focusing on a script with well-written code, trying to follow good design practices
and putting special attention on testability

## Installing BGM for EmulationStation

_Prerrequisites_: python >=3.7 is required to install this application. You can check your version
by executing this command on your machine:

```
python --version
```

or

```
python3 --version
```

Enter the RetroPie console (you can reach it by pressing the F4 key when EmulationStation
is running) and run the following commands:

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rydra/bgm-for-es/main/scripts/install-esbgm.py | python3 -
```

After installing, reboot the machine:

```
sudo reboot
```

## Uninstalling BGM for EmulationStation

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rydra/bgm-for-es/main/scripts/install-esbgm.py > install-esbgm.py
python3 install-esbgm.py --uninstall
```

## Enabling/Disabling the background music

Under the config section of EmulationStation two new commands have been added:

- Enable background music
- Disable background music

Select one or the other to enable or disable the background music

## How it works

Place your music in .mp3 or .ogg format in the folder that will be created in `/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/music`.
You can change the folder where you place your music in the config file (see _Configuration_ section).
Once you reboot and the script
starts, a default config file will be created at `/home/pi/.config/esbgm/config.yaml`

If you want to manually execute the application you can execute the following command:

```
esbgm
```

## Configuration

The configuration file that you may find in `/home/pi/.config/esbgm/config.yaml` (it will appear
once you start the `esbgm` script for the first time) contains the following content:

```yaml
# Value (in seconds) to delay audio start.  If you have a splash screen with audio and the script is playing music over the top of it, increase this value to delay the script from starting.
startdelay: 0

# The directory where you will place your music in .mp3 or .ogg format
musicdir: ~/RetroPie/roms/music

# Whether the music should restart upon unpausing or resume
# from where it was left out.
restart: true
startsong:

# The main process. Upon starting this process, the music will start playing...
mainprocess: emulationstatio

# unless one of these processes is running, then the music will fade out
# until only the mainprocess is running again
